### Hi there 👋

I entitled myself  “software developer”, aware that I would not be one If my professors and all other programmers around the world would not exist. They are the reasons that allowed me one day to be a software developer. If their knowledge hadn't been shared, how would I be a programmer ?

Learning is forever....
