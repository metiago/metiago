### Hi there 👋

I entitled myself “software developer”, aware that everything is connected and no one can be a software developer by itself. If my professors and all other programmers around the world do not exist I would not be able to execute this role. These people are the causes that contributed toward my evolution as a software developer. If their knowledge hadn't been shared, how would I call myself a “software developer” ?
