### Hi there 👋

I entitled myself “software developer”, aware that everything is connected, and also If my professors and all other programmers around the world do not exist I would not be able to execute this role.
These people are reasons that contributed toward my evolution as software developer. If their knowledge hadn't been shared, how would I be a “software developer” ?

Learning is forever...
